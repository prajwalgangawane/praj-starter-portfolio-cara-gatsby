## About

It takes knowledge, smart work, and dedication to make great ideas come to life. I have been helping make great ideas happen from past years and am always ready for new challenges.

Problem solving is not always about sitting in a board room talking about the way things should be done. I have a strong background in System design which allows me to think on my feet and act upon it.
